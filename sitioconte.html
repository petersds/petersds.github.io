            <h2>Sitio Conte</h2>
            <p>Located in central Panama, the Rio Grande de Coclé floods during the rainy season. In the early 20th
                century, the Conte
                family noticed that the shifting course of the river was exposing ancient burials on the river’s edge.
                During the 1930s, the Peabody
                Museum excavated the now-famous Sitio Conte (Conte Site) and found archaeological evidence of a large
                cemetery including
                an impressive burial of a chief that had been buried with lots of gold and numerous other individuals.
                The evidence,
                although dating to the late 1st millennium CE, seemed to corroborate Spanish accounts of events and
                rituals surrounding
                the burial of powerful chiefs for the Quevi culture in the late 16th century CE.</p>

            <h3>Prominent Graves</h3>
            <p>Grave 1 is considered to be one of the more prominent unearthed during the Peabody excavation. It dates
                to AD
                400-500. Those who were interred have been interpreted to be a "chief and three of his retainers". The
                primary
                occupant, skeleton 1, was interred in a seated position and lavishly adorned with grave goods. Among
                these were
                eight effigy vessels and 112 plates or bowls, all of which were spread along the edge of the grave.</p>

            <p>Also included were gold or tumbaga beads, pendants, greaves and chisels, a canine teeth apron, mirror
                backs, whale teeth
                and carved manatee ribs with gold overlay, seventeen hundred serpentine beads and several bundles of
                stingray spines.
                Skeleton two also had many of these same objects in association, as well as a small quantity of celts
                and stone blades.
                The remaining skeletons had similar grave goods, although fewer in number.</p>

            <p>Grave 26. One of the richest graves of the Peabody excavations, Grave 26 contained 22 skeletons and
                dates to the same period
                as Grave 5. The primary occupant, skeleton 12, was interred in a seated position and was once enclosed
                in a makeshift
                hut. Forming the floor of the grave were a number of ceramics, a stone slab and the remainder of the
                grave's
                occupants.occupants.</p>

            <p>Some of the grave goods that are associated with the primary interment include gold or tumbaga plaques,
                cuffs, greaves,
                beads, carved whale teeth and manatee ribs, stingray spines and an emerald. Of the 126 ceramic
                pieces found in Grave
                26, a majority of them lined the walls of the grave. These included thirty-six effigy vessels and ninety
                polychrome
                plates. The other occupants had a few grave goods, including several gold ear rods, which were
                associated with Skeleton
                8</p>

            <h3>The Art of Sitio Conte</h3>
            <p>The iconography of the gold and ceramic pieces at Sitio Conte reflects a highly refined artistry. While
                some figures are
                abstract representations of animals, others appear to be therianthropic in nature. These figures mostly
                appear in two
                basic designs, single or paired. There are exceptions to this as some ceramics contain multiple
                images as well.</p>
            <div class="row"><img class="image-max" src="./images/sitio7.jpg" alt="Photo of Gold Disk 30-49-20/C11058 " /></div>

            <p>The iconography of the gold pieces varies from animals such as bats, deer, sharks, crocodiles, and
                saurians to human
                and therianthropic figures. Many of these subjects are represented in the iconography of the Coclé style
                ceramics that
                appear within the burials. They also include images of snakes, birds, turtles, crabs, insects, frogs,
                stingrays,
                armadillos and monkeys. It has been suggested that the inclusion of these gold and ceramic pieces
                may represent the
                rank of the individuals with whom they are associated</p>
