<h2>name of site:</h2>
<p>Online Collections</p>

<h3>purpose:</h3>
<p>this site will showcase the vast collections that the PMAE stewards and provide a place to share those
collections with the many constituents who access the collections. The idea is to create content to engage the public, more curated content for researchers, faculty, and students, and allow for native groups to access objects that are being put together under NAGPRA laws for review (not all communities can travel onsite). Hopefully, researchers will be able to gather information they need from the site with minimal assistance from staff. This is also to help make the collections more compliant with open access,
and transparent in collecting history.</p>
