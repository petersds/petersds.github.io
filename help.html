            <h3>Keyword Search</h3>
            <p>
                Keyword Search queries a number of fields (categories of information) in the database at the same time
                for each of the
                terms entered and returns the records where each term was found in at least one field. The more terms
                added in Keyword
                Search, the narrower the search results will be. A list of the "behind the scenes" fields used in
                Keyword Search is
                available below under Database Fields Queried by Keyword Search.
            </p>

            <p>Separate each keyword by a space. Most punctuation marks will be ignored.</p>
            <p>The below example will return records where all terms (marble, and pigment, and gold) are found somewhere
                in
                a
                record.
                Records that contain marble and pigment, but not gold, will not be included in the results since only
                two
                of
                the entered
                terms match for those records. --! I think this is an OR search !--</p>

            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic">marble pigment gold</span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To search for an exact phrase, enclose the phrase in double quotes. The below example would only find
                records that
                include the complete phrase, "Shrine in the Temple of the Cross" in any of the queried fields. Phrase
                searching is
                most useful when
                looking for the exact title of an object or a person's name.</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic">"Chauncey C. Nash"</span>
            </p>

            <h3>Additional Considerations for Keyword Searching</h3>
            <p>Searches are not case sensitive.</p>
            <p>The following special characters and punctuation marks are ignored in searches: |, *, ^, (, ), $, ~, {,
                }, @, +, #, !,
                and , (comma). Blue+bead, blue; bead, and blue, bead are all treated the same as blue bead and retrieve
                the same
                results.</p>
            <p>Except when using phrase search (multiple words surrounded by double quotes), the following words are
                ignored for search
                purposes: of, the, a, and, in.</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic"> Shrine in the Temple of the Cross (without double quotes) will search
                    only for the
                    words Shrine and Temple and Cross ignoring the
                    words, in and the and of. This works similarly to web searches and is intended to reduce the number
                    of
                    unwanted or irrelevant
                    results.</span>

            <h3>Database Fields Queried by Keyword Search</h3>
            <p>The Keyword Search feature of Peabody Museum's Online Collections site queries a number of fields in the
                database at the
                same time. Results include all object records with matching values in any of the fields described below.
                See Help for
                the Advanced Search feature for details about more strictly defined queries.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Search</h3>
            <p>
                Advanced Search provides additional control over querying the Peabody Museum's Online Collections
                database. Enter a term
                or multiple terms into the relevant fields to search by category of information. Most of the Advanced
                Search categories
                query multiple fields "behind the scenes" in online database. For a list of what kinds of information
                are searched by
                each Advanced Search field, see Database Fields Queried By Advanced Search below.
            </p>
            <p>Each additional term entered in each separate search category narrows the search.</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic"> : statue in Description and marble in Material
                    will return only objects that have statue in one of the fields searched by Description and
                    marble in the Material field. Statues that do not
                    have a Material of marble will not be included in the search results.
                </span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Multiple terms may be entered in any single field. Separate each term by a space to narrow the query
                (creating "and"
                relationships). Separate each term by the word OR in a field to include all records that match any, but
                not necessarily
                each, of the desired terms.</p>
            <p>Each additional term entered in each separate search category narrows the search.</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic">: marble pigment in the Material field will return only
                    objects that have both of those terms (marble and pigment) in either the Material field.
                </span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example (OR operator): <span class="italic"> marble OR pigment in the Material field will
                    return any objects that have either term, or both terms, in the Material.
                </span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To search for an exact phrase, enclose the phrase in double quotes. Phrase searching works in all of the
                Advanced Search
                fields except for Classification and Geography.Provenience/Site Name. An exact phrase search is assumed
                for
                Object
                Number, so quotes are not required for queries in that field. While phrase searching can be used in a
                number of the
                search fields, it is especially useful in the Description field (since it searches
                free-text fields in the
                database including Description and Title).</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic">"Shrine in the Temple of the Cross"</span>
            </p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                This example would only find records that include the complete phrase "Shrine in the Temple of the Cross
                in any of the
                relevant
                fields.

            </p>

            <h3>Additional Considerations for Advanced Searching</h3>
            <p>Searches are not case sensitive.</p>
            <p>The following special characters and punctuation marks are ignored in searches: |, *, ^, (, ), $, ~, {,
                }, @, +, #, !,
                and , (comma). Blue+bead, blue; bead, and blue, bead are all treated the same as blue bead and retrieve
                the same
                results.</p>
            <p>Except when using phrase search (multiple words surrounded by double quotes), the following words are
                ignored for search
                purposes: of, the, a, and, in.</p>
            <p class="grey-background">
                Example: <span class="italic"> Shrine in the Temple of the Cross (without double quotes) will search

            <h3>Viewing Records and Search Results</h3>

            <h4>Types of Results</h4>
            <p>There are different types of search results, such as object records and people records. When there is
                more than one type
                of result, you can choose different types of records to view.</p>

            <h4>Grid/List View</h4>
            <p>You can view a set of results in an image grid or list view. Use the dropdown to switch between different
                types of
                views.</p>

            <h4>Filters</h4>
            <p>You can refine a result set by using filters to narrow down results. For example, you can filter to see
                only works that
                have images within any result set. You can also clear each filter to revert to a larger result set, or
                clear all filters
                to get to your original result set.</p>

            <h4>Images</h4>
            <p>Why Is AN Image Shown As Unavailable?
                An image may be shown as not available if it is not yet available in our database, or if it cannot be
                displayed for
                copyright reasons.</p>
